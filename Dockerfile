# PixelOffice production image (single container: server + built client).
#
# Stage 1 (build): install all workspaces, build the client (vite build) so the
# server can serve client/dist as static files.
# Stage 2 (runtime): copy node_modules + sources + client/dist, run the server
# via tsx. The server consumes @pixeloffice/shared as TS source and runs the
# server entry with tsx (matches the `npm run start -w server` dev path), so no
# separate tsc build step is needed.
#
# Static client serving is opt-in: set SERVE_CLIENT=true so Express serves the
# built client on the same port as the API + ws transport. With it unset the
# image still runs the API/ws server only (zero-config dev path is unaffected).

# tini (PID 1) reaps zombies and forwards SIGTERM/SIGINT down the chain. We

# (→ `tsx src/index.ts`) but WITHOUT the npm wrapper, because npm-as-parent does
# NOT forward SIGTERM to its child, so the graceful shutdown sequence in
# lifecycle/shutdown.ts would never run under `docker stop` / k8s SIGTERM.
# (`node --import tsx ...` is also wrong: it spawns a node child that likewise
# never receives the signal. The tsx CLI, by contrast, forwards signals to its
# node child — verified locally: SIGTERM → "[shutdown] clean shutdown complete".)
# The binary is referenced explicitly since node_modules/.bin is not on PATH
# outside an npm script. chain: tini -> tsx -> node (server/src/index.ts).
