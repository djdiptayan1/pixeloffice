// The Colyseus office room — the ONLY Colyseus-aware module in the server.
//
// It is a thin protocol-handling shell: all business logic lives in the
// framework-free services (presence, events, calendar) injected via the
// container. The room:
//   - authenticates joins via the AuthProvider (no passwords, plan rule)
//   - assigns a desk spawn, holds the live PlayerSnapshot map
//   - validates movement (walkable + 1-tile steps; teleports excepted)
//   - drives the periodic presence/event ticks (the only place that reads the
//     system clock — services always receive `now` from here)
//   - translates service domain events into S2C wire messages
//
// Human agency: meetings/events NEVER auto-move an avatar. Only an explicit
// JOIN_EVENT / JOIN_MEETING message seats the sender at an anchor.
